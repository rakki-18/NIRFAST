function abs = waterAbsorption(f, T)
%WATERABSORPTION Calculate ultrasound absorption in distilled water.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
%     waterAbsorption calculates the ultrasonic absorption in distilled
%     water at a given temperature and frequency using a 7th order
%     polynomial fitted to the data given by Pinkerton (1949). 
%
% USAGE:
%     abs = waterAbsorption(f, T)
%
% INPUTS:
%     f             - array of frequency values [MHz]
%     T             - array of water temperature values [degC]
%
% OUTPUTS:
%     abs           - absorption [dB/cm]

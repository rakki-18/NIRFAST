# NIRFAST Matlab

### v9.1 (3/20/2018)

NIRFAST is a toolkit that consists of two main components:
1. [NIRFASTSlicer](https://github.com/nirfast-admin/NIRFASTSlicer) - A medical image processing and analysis component built on the 3DSLicer platform
2. [NIRFASTMatlab](https://github.com/nirfast-admin/NIRFAST) - The mesh generation and optical computation component built on MATLAB

Most users will need both packages as these work together for many use cases; however, some expert users may only need NIRFASTMatlab.

This README pertains to NIRFASTMatlab only.


## INSTALLATION of NIRFASTMatlab

1. Unzip Nirfast onto your computer.
2. Open Matlab, and go to File -> Set Path -> Add With Subfolders.
3. Select the Nirfast folder, then Save and Close.
4. Type 'nirfast' (no quotes) in the Matlab prompt to start the NIRFASTMatlab GUI.
